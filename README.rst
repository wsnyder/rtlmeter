RTLMeter
=======

RTLMeter is a collection of reference designs and tools for the evaluation of
open source EDA tools, primarily Verilator.

The goal of RTLMeter is to collect accurate and reproducible performance
metrics, which can be used to evaluate the performance of tools, and to
evaluate the effect of changes, options or other relevant differences in the
host environment.
